# Face-Update
For week 4 of [Programming for Artists](https://iq2prod1.smartcatalogiq.com/en/Catalogs/City-College-of-New-York/2017-2018/Undergraduate-Bulletin/Courses/ART-Art-Course-Descriptions/30000/ART-39552) and is an update on an [earlier Processing 5 Project](https://github.com/aekari/Face).

#### My goal was to:
- Create a Processing 5 sketch that displayed a repeated background that is triggered when the mouse x and y coordinates are within a particular range within the canvas.

```sh
for (int x = -55; x < 800; x = x+55) {          // create a for loop with these parameters for the X axis
    for (int y = -35; y < 800; y = y+55) {      // create another for loop with these other parameters for the y axis
      text("!!!", x, y);                        // write !!!
 };                                             // end of statement
```

#### Resources:
I used [The Coding Train on Youtube ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw) & [Processing 5's Reference page](https://processing.org/reference/).
