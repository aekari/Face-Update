## Description

This project was made during week 4 of [Programming for Artists](https://iq2prod1.smartcatalogiq.com/en/Catalogs/City-College-of-New-York/2017-2018/Undergraduate-Bulletin/Courses/ART-Art-Course-Descriptions/30000/ART-39552) and is an update on an [earlier Processing 5 Project](https://github.com/aekari/Face).

My goal was to create a Processing 5 sketch that displayed a repeated background that is triggered when the mouse x and y coordinates are hovering within a particular range of the canvas.

If you are curious how I accomplished this, please look the .[pde file](https://github.com/aekari/Face-Update/blob/master/face_update/face_update.pde) as I have commented every line of code explaining what everything means.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

1. Install [Processing](https://processing.org)
2. Download this repository to your local computer
3. Open the .pde file in Processing and run the sketch
4. Hover over the face to "wake up" the character and change the background ðŸ˜´â†’ðŸ˜²
