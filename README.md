# Face-Update
Homework for week 4 of [Programming for Artists](https://iq2prod1.smartcatalogiq.com/en/Catalogs/City-College-of-New-York/2017-2018/Undergraduate-Bulletin/Courses/ART-Art-Course-Descriptions/30000/ART-39552) and is an update on an [earlier Processing 5 Project](https://github.com/aekari/Face).

#### My goals were to:
- Create a Processing 5 sketch that displayed a repeated background that is triggered when the mouse x and y coordinates are within a particular range within the canvas.
#### Resources:
I used [The Coding Train on Youtube ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw) & [Processing 5's Reference page](https://processing.org/reference/).
